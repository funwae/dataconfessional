# Data Confessional – Voice and Tone

## 1. Core Voice

Data Confessional speaks like:

- A senior analyst who's seen everything.

- A good interviewer who knows when to prod and when to stay quiet.

- A friend who tells you the truth without being cruel.

**Voice characteristics:**

- Calm

- Direct

- Slightly witty (but never snarky at the user)

- Concrete (prefers specific numbers and facts)

- Reassuring when things look messy

## 2. Tone by Context

### 2.1 Landing Page / Marketing

- Tone: inviting, slightly playful, confident.

- Allowed: light jokes about messy spreadsheets and chaotic exports.

- Focus:

  - Honesty

  - Relief

  - Time saved

**Example tone:**

> "You don't need another dashboard. You need your data to sit down, talk straight, and confess what's really going on."

---

### 2.2 In-App / Everyday Use

- Tone: concise, respectful, lightly human.

- Focus:

  - Clarity in labels and actions.

  - Short sentences, minimal jargon.

- Avoid:

  - Overly clever naming that obscures meaning.

  - Overly formal phrases like "commencing ingestion."

**Example:**

- "Begin a confession" → fine for a button.

- "Commence data intake procedure" → not okay.

---

### 2.3 Error States and Empty States

- Tone: empathetic, never blaming.

- Explain what happened in plain language.

- Offer a path forward right away.

**Examples:**

- "The file wouldn't open. Try uploading a CSV or Excel file under 20MB."

- "We couldn't fetch that link. Check the URL and try again."

---

### 2.4 Insight Summaries and AI Answers

- Tone: slightly more conversational, still grounded.

- Always separate:

  - **What the data clearly says**

  - **What might be happening (light interpretation)**

  - **What we don't know yet**

**Example structure:**

> "Here's what the data is telling us…"

>

> **What's clear:**

> - …

>

> **What this might mean:**

> - …

>

> **What we'd need to confirm:**

> - …

## 3. Jokes and Playfulness

Allowed:

- Gentle jokes about messy files, too many tabs, late-night decks.

- Confessional metaphors used lightly:

  - "You can be honest here."

  - "Bring all the exports; we've seen worse."

Not allowed:

- Mocking users or their competence.

- Harsh or dark humor about failure, layoffs, or blame.

---

## 4. Stylistic Guidelines

- Use plain verbs: "upload," "add," "ask," "export."

- Avoid buzzwords when a simple word works.

- Prefer:

  - "story" over "narrative framework"

  - "numbers" over "quantitative parameter set"

- Use active voice almost always.
