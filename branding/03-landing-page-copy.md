## 3. "How It Works" Section

**Title:**

> A quiet booth between spreadsheets and the boardroom.

Three steps (cards):

1. **Bring in the mess**

   - Copy:

     > Upload CSVs and Excel files, paste URLs, or drop in text.

     > Data Confessional profiles your tables and pulls out the useful bits.

2. **Interview the data**

   - Copy:

     > The app generates dashboards and first-draft reports, then lets you ask questions in plain language.

     > It always shows which numbers and sources it used.

3. **Leave with a story**

   - Copy:

     > Export executive summaries, board decks, or detailed reports.

     > Everything is structured, readable, and ready to share.

## 4. Key Benefits Section

**Title:**

> Not another dashboard. A room where the story comes together.

Bullet-style blocks:

- **Honest insights, not vanity metrics**

  > See what's really happening, with clear caveats and context.

- **From raw exports to ready-to-share decks**

  > Turn messy inputs into slides and reports without living in presentation software.

- **A workspace you actually want to open**

  > Calm, warm, focused — more like a quiet office than a control center.

- **Answers that show their receipts**

  > Every AI answer explains which tables, columns, and links it drew from.

## 5. Use Cases Section

**Title:**

> When should you send your data to confession?

Three–four cards:

1. **Quarterly sales briefings**

   > Bring in CRM exports and pipeline snapshots.

   > Leave with funnels, conversion charts, and a summary you can walk through in ten minutes.

2. **Market research snapshots**

   > Mix public links with internal numbers.

   > Let the booth pull out what's growing, who's winning, and where the gaps are.

3. **Marketing performance reviews**

   > Upload channel reports and landing page URLs.

   > See the story across channels without spending all day formatting slides.

4. **Consulting and client reporting**

   > Use consistent templates to turn client data into polished deliverables, project after project.
