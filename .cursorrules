# Cursor Rules for Data Nexus

You are building a **production-quality full-stack web app** called **Data Nexus**.

## General

- **Follow the docs in `/docs` as the source of truth.**
- Default to **TypeScript** for all application code.
- Prefer **Next.js (App Router) + React + Tailwind CSS** for the frontend.
- Use **Node + Next API routes** or **separate FastAPI/Express backend** (the docs will clarify).
- Everything should be structured, typed, and easy to extend.

## Style & UX

- UI must feel:
  - Calm, analytical, business-friendly
  - Not "dev tool" cluttered, not "consumer app" goofy
- Prioritize:
  - Clear navigation between **Projects**, **Data**, **Dashboard**, **Reports**, **AI Q&A**
  - Minimal clicks to generate a **first-pass dashboard + report**

## AI Integration

- Abstract LLM access via a single `llmClient` layer.
- Never hardcode API keys; read from environment variables.
- Implement **prompt builders** as reusable helpers, informed by `/docs/06-ai-agent-and-prompting.md`.

## Data & Security

- Respect the models in `/docs/09-data-model.md`.
- Never log raw data or secrets in server logs.
- Assume PII may be present; follow best practices in `/docs/10-security-and-permissions.md`.

## What to Build First

1. Minimal auth (email or simple stub for now if needed).
2. Project list page + "Create Project" flow.
3. Data ingestion for CSV/XLSX and simple URL fetch.
4. Auto-profiling and suggested charts.
5. Basic AI Q&A panel that:
   - Reads project-scoped data summaries
   - Returns answers with references

## Don'ts

- Don't invent new features beyond what the docs describe without clear comments.
- Don't mix frontend and backend concerns in the same files.
- Don't tightly couple the LLM provider; use an abstraction.

When in doubt, **refer back to `/docs`**, keep things clean, and favor boring, maintainable solutions.
